# chinook-sql-project
This project showcases advanced SQL skills, including multi-table joins, grouping, and aggregation, applied to a realistic music store dataset. The findings support data-driven decision-making in a retail music sales environment.

Chinook SQL Data Analysis Project
This project analyzes sales and customer data from the Chinook digital music store database using SQL. It demonstrates the use of JOINs and aggregations to derive business insights from relational data.

Overview
The Chinook database contains information about customers, invoices, tracks, albums, artists, and genres.
The project focuses on answering key business questions, such as:

Countries with the Most Invoices – Identifies the countries generating the highest number of transactions.

Total Sales by Music Genre – Determines which music genres contribute the most revenue.

Top 10 Artists by Total Earnings – Shows the artists generating the highest sales to support marketing and promotion strategies.

Highest Spending Customers per Country – Highlights top customers in each country, including ties where applicable.

Project Deliverables
SQL Queries: Four unique queries, each containing at least one JOIN and one aggregation (COUNT, SUM, or AVG), formatted for readability.

Visualizations: Four charts (bar/column) created from the query results, showing trends in sales, geography, genre preference, and customer contributions.

Presentation: A concise 4-slide presentation (PDF/PPT) with visualizations and brief insights for each analysis.

Queries Text File: Includes all SQL queries with short explanations of their purpose.

Purpose
The analysis provides actionable insights for:

Understanding geographic trends in sales.

Identifying high-revenue artists and genres.

Recognizing top customers for targeted engagement.

Informing strategic marketing and inventory decisions.
